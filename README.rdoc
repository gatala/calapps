==Welcome to the UC Berkeley Application Gallery

Project Purpose
  As the campus continues to make its data more open and accessible, the number of applications built by 
  students and other developers is growing. We need an ‘app store’ for the campus to showcase these apps 
  and to provide a valuable service to both the developers and the end users. The app gallery will be 
  prominent on the campus API portal <developer.berkeley.edu>.

Brief Description
  This is a Ruby on Rails web app that hopes to serve as a searchable catalog for innovative campus apps.
